# RaspPi-Cluster

The following tutorial I will use a four node Raspberry Pi Cluster for an example.

> (And I'll use my preferred selection between many similar options.)

After setting up the environment, I'll implement some popular distributed computing ecosystem on it.
And try to write a quick start script for them. And maybe some application damo.

## Usage

(put some useage of instant-use script here)

## Applications

## Steps

A step by step record of how I build this system.

* [Preparation](Preparation.md)
    * Hardware purchase
    * Software package and dependencies install

1. [Setup Raspberry Pis](SetupRaspPi.md)
2. Assemble hardwares
    ![rpi-cluster](Picture/FourNodesRaspberryPiCluster.jpeg)
3. [Setup fabric](SetupFabric.md) - execute shell commands remotely over SSH to all hosts at once!

## Notes about distributed computing

* [MapReduce](Notes/Distributed_Computing/MapReduce.md)

## TODO

try hadoop, spark, kubernetes
