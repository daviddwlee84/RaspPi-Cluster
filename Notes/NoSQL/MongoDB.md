## CAP Theorem

[CAP theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAP_theorem)

* Consistency: Every read receives the most recent write or an error
* Avalibility: Every request receives a (non-error) response – without the guarantee that it contains the most recent write
* Partition tolerance: The system continues to operate despite an arbitrary number of messages being dropped (or delayed) by the network between nodes
